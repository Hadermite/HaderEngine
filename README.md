# HaderEngine
NOTE: It's currently in an early stage, so it's not meant to be used quite yet.

## What is HaderEngine?
HaderEngine is a Java game engine that is currently under development. The goal with HaderEngine is to make it as easy as possible for the developer to make games. It comes with handy features right out of the box so you as a developer can get started quickly. It makes it really good for Ludum Dare.

## How do I use HaderEninge?
A gettings started guide is under construction.

## Am I allowed to use it?
